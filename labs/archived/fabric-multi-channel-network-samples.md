# Scope of Lab
This lab is based on [Build Your First Network](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples).

After the [tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html), a Fabric beginner may want to find out multi channel network samples, and these are the samples.
Currently, There are two multi-channel-network samples from 'byfn' and 'fabric-ca' both are based on 'fabric-samples' repo.
