# Lab Name
crypto-lib

# Short Description
A project for experimentation on creating shared cryptography modules for cross-project collaboration

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to serve as an initial launching point for what will hopefully become a shared Hyperledger cryptography library.  We aim to use this lab to set up a code base and experiment with integrating cryptographic protocols between projects.
