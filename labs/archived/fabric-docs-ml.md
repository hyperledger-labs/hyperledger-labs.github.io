# Lab Name
Fabric Docs ML

# Short Description
A project to translate the Fabric documentation into Malayalam.

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to translate the Fabric documentation into Malayalam. We will use this repository to sync with the latest English version of Hyperledger Fabric, starting with version 2.1.

For subsequent releases, any update to source files will be translated in a new release base branch. Issues are used to track what to update in the changed docs.
