# Lab Name
Web3DB 

# Short Description
Web3DB is a decentralized relational database interface that manages the data generated by end users in a distributed and zero-trust manner. It uses a blockchain-based identity management to enable fine-grained access control over the data shared by end users. It uses InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the persistant storage to ensure transparency and robustness.

# Scope of Lab
The Web3DB project aims to provide a zero-trust data sharing cyberinfrastructure, where data owners (DOs, e.g., users or entities generating data) truly have the ownership by not trusting but verifying, i.e., letting them verify all the records/logs to be assured that their data is shared/used in the way they want. Web3DB will let DOs contribute their data to a decentralized database that is managed in a zero-trust manner while preserving data security and individual privacy. The data consumers (DCs, e.g., service providers or entities using the data) will use DOsâ€™ data with the constraints of the access policies defined by the DOs.

The Web3DB will provide the following features:
+ Decentralized Identity Management with Strong Individual Privacy: The identity of DOs and DCs will be managed in a decentralized manner using the blockchain. The privacy of the individual will be preserved by using the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technique.
+ Zero-trust Fine-grained Access Control Enforcement with User-side Encryption: We will develop the hybrid solution with cryptography and trusted execution environment (TEE) to achieve zero-trust access control enforcement. The DOs will be able to define the fine-grained access policies for their data, and the Web3DB will enforce the access control based on the policies.
+ Strong Data Integrity and Transparency: Web3DB will use IPFS as the distributed persistent storage for the data submitted by DOs to ensure the data integrity and transparency.
+ Standard SQL Interface for Data Query: The Web3DB will provide a standard SQL interface for data query, which will be compatible with the existing SQL-based applications.
